### Reflection
In the realm of data visualization, the U.S. Election Twitter Network Graph Tool stands out as a pioneering application designed to map the intricate web of interactions among U.S. politicians on Twitter. Developed by Emmi Bevensee, a Mozilla Fellow, and co-authored with Max Aliapoulios, this tool leverages the Social Media Analysis Toolkit (SMAT) to provide a live, updating, and interactive network graph. This visualization is not just a mere representation of data; it's a lens through which the dynamics of political influence and connections during the 2020 U.S. election are elucidated.

The network graph is a testament to the confluence of computer science, mathematics, and social sciences, offering a bird's eye view of the political discourse on Twitter. It reveals who interacts with whom, the nature of these interactions, and the influential nodes within the network. For instance, by examining the graph, one can discern which accounts are most frequently mentioned or replied to by prominent political figures, such as the president, thereby uncovering patterns of influence and communication strategies.

Moreover, the tool incorporates features such as a search function for locating politicians by username, zoom capabilities for detailed analysis, and the ability to share direct links to specific user connections. It employs nodes to represent individual Twitter accounts and edges to depict the connections between them, whether through direct replies or mentions. This directed graph approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the flow of information and influence across the network.

Nodes: These are the circles. A node is an entity in a graph. In this example each node represents a single Twitter account. Edge: These are the lines. An edge is a connection between two nodes. These represent some form of connection between two nodes. Directed graph: A directed graph is where the edges represent some flow of information. So for example, a network graph showing contagion would be considered directed because contagion moves from one individual to another. Layout: The layout of this graph has to do with the way the nodes are distributed. For example tightly connected nodes tend to be closer together. Outbound and Inbound Activity: Shows a list of users who the current selected user has interacted or was interacted with. In the outbound scenario, the list shows users who the selected user has mentioned or replied to. In the inbound scenario, the list shows users who have direct mentioned or replied to the selected user. All the detailed lists included users not in the seed lists from CSPAN.

By diving more deeply into the Inbound Activity tab we can see suspicious activity such as one of the top Biden hate repliers is this account who replies to him thousands of times. Thereâ€™s also a small account seemingly pretending to be a deceased (Canadian) pro athlete also responding to Trump thousands of times with a repeated script.
